# 🧠 Diabetes Prediction Model Optimization and Deployment

## 📌 Project Overview

This project compares and optimizes multiple classification models to predict diabetes using a structured machine learning pipeline. The focus is on model performance evaluation, hyper-parameter tuning, and visual comparison through a dashboard.

---

## 🔍 Problem Statement

The objective of this project is to:

1. Divide the dataset into training and testing sets.
2. Train at least five classification models:
   - Logistic Regression
   - Decision Tree
   - Random Forest
   - Support Vector Machine
   - Gradient Boosting
3. Evaluate each model using:
   - Accuracy
   - Precision
   - Recall
   - F1-score
   - R² Score (for extended insight)
4. Perform hyper-parameter tuning (Grid Search, Random Search).
5. Visualize model comparisons with a dashboard.
